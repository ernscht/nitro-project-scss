# Your Project

Introduction …

## do / issues

* build contains too much code (e.g. "./molecules/example/css/modifier/example-blue.scss")
* enable hot module reloading with `mini-css-extract-plugin` when ready
* test with big project
* check stylelint config (works unreliable & lintDirtyModulesOnly does not work as expected)
* test error handling on file actions (delete/add src files/folder)
* cleanup (_app, examples, ... )

### prio 2

* how to handle eslint error concerning `module` not defined
* outsource loading of assets and hot in entry files
* check postcss loader & other loaders
* check [devtool performance](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/)
* better console output
* cleanup config folder (maybe move gulp to config)
* documentation

### prio 3

* eslint should lint only changed files
* use "gondel"
* rename `app` to `server`
